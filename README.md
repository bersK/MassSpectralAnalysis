# MassSpectralAnalysis
This project has been created by the inFrames team for the Space Apps 2019 hackathon (i.e. experimental time crunched code that might break... thread forward carefully).

The idea about the project was an imagination of the future of planet exploration outside Earth. What if we had more advanced hardware to collect samples and sort through them on the spot and do some kind of advanced preliminary checks.

## Requirements
- Unreal Engine 4.23
- A capable PC - A respectable discrete GPU/APU
  
Use Unreal Engine 4.23 and open the project by double clicking `nasapg.uproject` file. Launching for the first time will take a minute but don't worry! It's generating material previews and etc. Once that's finished feel free to explore the project.
